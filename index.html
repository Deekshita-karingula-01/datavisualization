      <h4>Description:</h4>
      <p> This interactive bar chart, titled "Building Utility Distribution by Count" offers a comprehensive view of the distribution of building utilities within a dataset. The chart visualizes the count of different building utilities on the x-axis, showcasing the variety of utilities available, and the count of buildings employing each utility on the y-axis.</p>
      <p> A distinguishing feature of this graph is its interactivity. Users can select specific utility categories using the interactive brush tool, which dynamically updates the visualization to display the count of buildings for the selected utilities. Clicking on the graph provides an interactive rectangular interface that can be adjusted by scrolling the mouse wheel. As the rectangle expands or contracts, the red bar representing the count of usages adjusts accordingly, providing users with a dynamic and customizable exploration of the data. This unique feature allows for precise and interactive analysis of building utility distribution.</p>
      <p> Moreover, informative tooltips are provided to enhance the user experience. Hovering over any bar reveals details, including the name of the building utility and the total count. This enables users to gain deeper insights into the distribution of building utilities and make data-driven decisions. The graph is a powerful tool for exploring the distribution of building utilities and understanding their prevalence in the dataset, making it useful for various analytical purposes.</p>
